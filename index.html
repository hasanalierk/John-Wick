        <div class="par1">
          John Wick is on the run, being hunted with a $14 million 'open'
          contract on his life for breaking a foundational rule: taking a life
          on Continental Hotel grounds. The victim, Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo
          Scamarcio) was a member of the High Table, the organization that
          ordered the open contract. John should have already been executed, but
          the Continental's manager, Winston Scott (Ian McShane), has given him
          a one-hour grace period before he is excommunicado—his membership will
          be revoked and he will be banned from all services and cut off from
          other members. John uses favors and contacts accrued in his former
          life to stay alive as he fights his way out of New York City. The
          third film was announced in October 2016, production began in early
          2018 and was released in May 2019.

          In May 2019, prior to the release of John Wick: Chapter 3 –
          Parabellum, Chad Stahelski confirmed on a Reddit "Ask Me Anything"
          thread that there has been discussion of another film.Keanu Reeves has
          also stated that he would continue as long as the films are
          successful.Lionsgate officially announced the film during John Wick
          3's opening week, with a scheduled release date of May 21,
          2021.However, in April 2020, during an interview with Collider,
          Stahelski revealed that the film would most likely not make its 2021
          release date due to his commitment to The Matrix Resurrections.He
          also revealed, during the same interview, that a 100-page "scriptment"
          (part script/part outline) had been written for the film.The

          due to commence in June 2021 in Paris and Berlin, with additional
          filming in Japan and New York City.Partly due to the COVID-19
          pandemic, the film is now scheduled for release on March 24, 2023.In
